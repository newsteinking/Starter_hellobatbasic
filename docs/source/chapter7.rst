4-1-3 Pins of Micro:bit

From the schematic diagram in P4-1-3, you can see that the touch magic
lights is connected to the P0 of the Micro:bit. You can use the blocks
of music directly.

2. **Learning goals**

In this course, we will study how to make HelloBot robot sing “Happy
Birthday”

**3.Programming**

3.1 Programming online

1) You should use the USB cable to connect the micro:bit to the
computer, at this point, the computer will have a micro:bit U disk. You
need to open it, click micro:bit website, then entered the micro:bit
website or you can enter the URL directly in your browser:
http://microbit.org/

2) After entering the programming interface, you need to click Add
package and copy the HelloBot package URL:
https://github.com/lzty634158/HelloBot to the input field, click to
confirm the add package. Then you can use the blocks of the HelloBot
package.

3.2 Programming offline

1) You can double-click to use it. As shown in the following figure.

2) After entering the programming interface, you need to click Add
package and copy the HelloBot package URL:
https://github.com/lzty634158/HelloBot to the input field, click to
confirm the add package. Then you can use the blocks of the HelloBot
package.

Note: The package only needs to be added once. If you have added
