Chapter2 :로봇에 있는 다양한 컬러 빛을 내보자
====================================================================

1.Preparation
--------------------
1.You should learn about the position of the colorful lights in the body
of hellobot；

2.You should learn about the micro:bit pins connected to the colorful
lights in the schematic.

1-2-4 Pins of Micro:bit

From the schematic diagram in P1-1-3, you can see that the colorful
lights is connected to the P16 of the Micro:bit.

Note:In the bottom layer of the HelloBot package has been set parameter
for the user, you can directly drag the colorful lights building blocks.

2. **Learning goals**

In this lesson, we will learn to light up four colorful lamps in turn,
the colorful lamps will emit light of different colors.

**3.Programming**

3.1 Programming online

1) You should use the USB cable to connect the micro:bit to the
computer, at this point, the computer will have a micro:bit U disk. You
need to open it, click micro:bit website, then entered the micro:bit
website or you can enter the URL directly in your browser:
http://microbit.org/

2) After entering the programming interface, you need to click Add
package and copy the HelloBot package URL:
https://github.com/lzty634158/HelloBot to the input field, click to
confirm the add package. Then you can use the blocks of the HelloBot
package.

3.2 Programming offline

1) You can double-click to use it. As shown in the following figure.

2) After entering the programming interface, you need to click Add
package and copy the HelloBot package URL:
https://github.com/lzty634158/HelloBot to the input field, click to
confirm the add package. Then you can use the blocks of the HelloBot
package.

**Note: The package only needs to be added once. If you have added
packages in the previous lessons, this course does not need to be added
repeatedly.**

**4.Download programming**

You need to make sure that the micro:bit development board is connected
to the computer. Then you should click on the download in the lower left
corner as shown in P 1-2-9 to download the program to micro:bit.
